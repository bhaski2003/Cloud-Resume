The providers in  the terraform are like the baisc units of the terrform itself

Each provider adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage.

Every resource type is implemented by a provider; without providers, 
Terraform can't manage any kind of infrastructure.

In this project we're gonna make use of the AWS Provider , which is given to us by the official docs of the terraform

It says - " Use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider to interact with the many resources supported by AWS.
 You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it. "
